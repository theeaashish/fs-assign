What is Bun?
Bun is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps.
It ships as a single executable called bun.

At its core is the Bun runtime, a fast JavaScript runtime designed as
a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It's written in Zig and powered by
JavaScriptCore under the hood, dramatically reducing startup times
and memory usage.
